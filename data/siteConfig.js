  authorDescription: `Always interested in the work of programs from within. I started to study Pascal when I was in school. <br />
    In 2012 I started trainee as a junior developer to make web interface for 3d models. Since then I develop web-sites all
  the time: as a part-time job during study in the university; as a co-founder of a startup team; as a hired full-stack
  specialist - I've always made web pages. And I like it!<br/>
    Currently I'm working as full-stack web developer with <strong>Yii2 (PHP), MariaDB, RappidJS (Backbone.js), Grunt and Docker.</strong><br/>
  Besides this I'm interested in React default stack: React+Jest+Webpack`,
